They are also exploring the fluid identities that have come into being despite (or because of) boundaries set by the restrictions of recent times.  Their background in fine art and computer science gives them a multilayered perspective, so that in their work, sculptural representations are augmented with lighting and code to facilitate the development of a platform for that multiple approach.  These also form the basis of a metanarrative, considering the role of storytelling in describing planes of existence and their labyrinthine backdrop. A sub-narrative is the exploration of fabricated speculative AI, which offers a completely different, yet closely related, viewpoint.  Channelling their fascination with surrealism, they employ the playfully subversive tactics of that dynamic practice to present ideas and pose questions - but not provide answers.

According to Kant, we are convinced that it is an error, as long as we recognise that a single perception is impossible. This degree of certainty depends on being satisfactory in the token of the necessity of truth when it is objectively grasped, but as long as it is subjectively examined, the certainty is greater as long as the perception of this inevitable involves more intuition. She is a cross disciplinary practitioner, and her recent work has employed a range of techniques; including Computational generating image with her basic interests of visualisation.
