Nowadays, when women post photos about themselves on social networks, they always receive various comments. A large part of these comments is about the evaluations of their bodies. It can cause many women to feel anxious about their body shapes.
Women and water are where life begins, water is also regarded as feminine symbol: in traditional Chinese culture women are made by water. Cheng uses five different shapes of glasses with water inside to represent different shapes of women bodies, the audience can knock the glasses to see the animations from a projector. Cheng choose to use vibration sensors to detect every knock, transfer the data through esp32 feather to openFrameworks. Knocking in this project is about the evaluations of different women from a knocker. 
During the exhibition, Cheng will break one of these glasses and present the broken pieces on the table every day. It represents women should not be constrained by the shape of glasses, water is intangible, like our souls are also free.

The brain is like a computer, with each person’s brain containing a unique code and all the experiences and emotions hidden in the subconscious functioning like algorithms that perform spontaneous calculations, eventually giving rise to images derived from a stream of consciousness. 

On countless occasions, when leaving home, Chaojing’s mind has been beset by the image of pervading seawater gradually rising from under her feet, submerging her whole body, and rendering her unable to breathe. She is like a diver, sinking deep into the sea. Such a stream of consciousness is her personal feeling of homesickness. Deconstructing her imagination, on the surface she seems to feel suffocated because of homesickness, but in truth, it is the contrary. The sea represents the strangeness of new things. We know that when first being submerged into the sea, people have a strange fear. However, once used to it, the underwater world is exhilarating. To equate the feeling of leaving home with sinking into the sea represents not sorrow, but courage - to summon one’s heart and soul to explore a new world.

Still footages of empty rooms, corridors, or walkways become the relics of our urban loneliness...The void exists within and around us, as much as we try to avoid it. This project frames and situates surveillance cameras as vessels of our voids.

Traversing the blurring boundaries between presences and absences, one's presence will always be confused by their absence, as they are relative qualities. While one's presence can be seen, heard, or felt with evidence, absences are not as simple. Surveillance cameras become didactic tools that show us that absences are not to be avoided. How will you bring these pieces of videographic evidences to question your own existence and relationship with your surroundings? 

Self-reflexive of resolution, composition, and the concept of framing, this project also challenges the notion of truth. As truths are limited by the borders of the camera lens, an event is never truly captured. Cinema verite will always be a fabrication of reality, far from other truths or perspectives.

The performance makes use of 12 speakers, strategically dispersed around the space, which come together to form an immersive surround sound system. Sound effects including audio panning, echo, delay, and more, are combined in real time to create depth of field and a distortion in the audience’s spatial awareness. The physical space, with its geometric visual compositions projected onto three walls, in turn further distorts their perception.

His concept of 'traumatised entities' indicate to our collective suffering from a deep rooted belief in dualities and how we can liberate ourselves from it with the help of computation.  

Aligned with Whiteheadian process philosophical thought, inspired by Taoist and Buddhist epistemology, his research questions and queers the anthropocentric relations between machines and human that strictly follows a doctrine of mechanical reductionism for efficiency in capital growth, military development and authoritarian facilitators while explores innovative methods for human-computer interaction aiming for collective healing. He simulates speculative process metaphysics to bridge the meaning of art and process of healing as a holistic being that dissolves the boundaries in this traumatised reality.","The Poetry of Change","“The Poetry of Change” is an immersive interactive installation that simulates eastern shamanic ritual using symbols from Iching, interpretation of the symbols and 2D moving images to assemble space for meditation, purification and healing. The three visual elements will be displayed on a retro CRT monitor, an LCD monitor and projected on a textile fixated on the soft ground, respectively. The 2D moving images are generated by an image-processing system called Tao-machine from Yishuai's research “Tao-machine: Bridging Symbolic Logic from Iching and Computational Image-processing Syntaxes through the Model of Speculative Process Metaphysics”.  

Immersed inside the light of the moving images, the audience can push the illuminating portal’s button on the ground, activating the spatial shift through the concurrent changes of all three visual elements. “The Poetry of Change” queers the overwhelmingly expanding info-sphere in modern society by using enveloped information in symbols, their interpretations and colour dynamic as the signifiers and the signified, co-creating an immersive environment as being in the pure mode of aesthetic experience. By focusing on the processes of these changes, the threads of thinking are dissolved into a state of nothingness in constant flow, initiating the process of self-healing.

Creating unique data sets using images generated with Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning techniques, I explore these questions by algorithmically extracting and generating image information. Generating images from their original source material and separating them from their referent subject, I have created my own archive with the express purpose of information extraction and creation. Theoretically unlimited in scope, it has been recreated physically to create a dialogue between its constituent images. These images have been removed from their native form to be forgotten. What remains will be their essence, through ill-defined hazy memory.

The reaction to light is an abstract interpretation of positive and negative phototropism and the behavior of plants that grow towards or turn away from light.  The Trametes form, on the other hand, was inspired by the fungi of the genus Polyporales and Auricularia, and the stony corals of the genus Merulina ampliata.
The project is a response to the combination of fashion, technology, reactions and a variety of forms that occur in nature.

Currently, the most commonly used intereactive wearables are smart watches, while in the future we will certainly add this range to other wardrobe products.
For many years, we have been able to observe the work of designers such as Hussein Chalayan, Ying Gao, Anouk Wipprecht or Iris van Herpen, who combine fashion and technology to create true works of art.

Skyenc was a prototype for a new line of Cyborg sexbots that were abandoned after the laws were changed. 

Skyenc gained celebrity status when she produced and starred in a long-running Virtual Reality (VR) series about her life called The Sky-enc Has No Limits. She was widely known for the drama and quantity of her romantic relationships, along with the fact that there wasn’t much of a distinction between her public and private life. Unlike most celebrities, Skyenc enjoyed being hounded by paparazzi, and lurid details about her life were often featured in gossip media. She had live-streamed VR cameras in her home that broadcast continuously for almost eight years, until the flare. Beyond the voyeuristic nature of this broadcast, it helped to educate the general public about her day-to-day life and the maintenance of her Cyborg body. 

Skyenc’s best-selling printed poetry collection, Booty Call, contained romantic poems dedicated to various lovers.

Even when our deceased ancestors cross over, their souls still live on and exist in a parallel world. The Vietnamese want their ascendants to continue living in abundance. Amid numerous rituals and religious attempts to communicate between worlds, burning offers a dynamic gateway not only in spiritual connection but also in material outlet. For generations, people have been spending excessive money on votive offerings, in hope of exchanging it some future fortune, without realising how much resource wastage, and extreme pollution they also cause in their own lives. 

Between Fire hopes to bring this analog act into the digital format by making the visitors a part of the artwork as the flames spread when the votive paper is offered. Created with openFrameworks and Kinect sensor, the burning flames computed by real-time weather data from Saigon — the artist’s hometown. This pays homage to Viet culture where we celebrate family value. The windier Saigon is, the bigger the flames become; the more humid the air is, the faster the flames die.

The project attempts to subvert the goal-oriented militaristic ideologies historically tied with the video-game medium by exploring games without an end goal, win or loss state.  

During a residency with Offsite Projects and Agorama, Jonas researched the relationship between folksonomy and machine learning data by researching the term ‘nature’ within linguistic classification systems by investigating large content repositories like flickr.com, freesound.org and archive.org that require collaborative indexing. This research period has informed the conceptual framework for this project. 

In the Unity game-engine, the environment is continually destroyed and regenerated procedurally as the player explores their surroundings. The landscape may spawn anomalous objects, which represent absurd terms tagged in relation to ‘nature’ identified during Jonas’ research. This automates unique player-experiences of nature that are mediated by language.

In psychology, cognitive dissonance is believed to occur when a person holds two or more conflicting beliefs, this can result in mental stress, which the individual will do anything in their power to change. Drawing on this concept, the Chandelier places emotions at the front lines of the autonomic nervous system, it follows that holding two or more feelings at the same time may cause 'affective dissonance,' and that laughing, crying and other physiological reactions evolved as fast-acting coping mechanisms designed to release this tension. Inspired by Vibrant Materialism and Affect Theory, this piece is an investigation of what happens when an object with a bi-directional emotional signature becomes animate, creating an intricate space of conflicting affects in order to engage with its audience.

The Cloud transforms them and they become immaterial and distant as is the knowledge, memories and identity stored in the virtual space.
The anxieties that were intimately connected to these automatic drawings lose their strength in the virtual realm. The Cloud is public, controlled by code, which creates mirror images of the drawings trapped in a precise world in a never-ending movement.

📉 is situated between the disciplines of painting and interface design. 
The animate virtual environment comprises 'motion paintings' and the viewer is allowed to engage and participate with the motions through very simple, intuitive inputs.

Built in the Unity game engine and using the C# language, the environment includes background textures of videos captured from other software environments and handheld shots which are also gestural paintings with light and motion. These videos cannot be navigated in 3D space, which complicates the notion of onscreen tangibility. The LEDs which mirror color values from the edge of the screen suggest further complications and the screen's affect on the world.

Cues that can be revealed in the environment deliberately allude to the human labour and decisions made in its creation. 

📉 is a response to the aesthetic 'flattening' resulting from design paradigms optimised for a disembodied, consumption-first digital life. Through deeper understanding of the interfaces that rule our lives we can perhaps see through them, and more importantly, create our own.

The pace of the video is slow, long shots pan over bodily forms, and linger on skeletal figures. The video is overlaid with text which draws on tropes of gothic literature, including distrust of medical advancement. The text questions the fidelity of medical imaging, including x-rays and MRIs, which raise questions about the fidelity and objectivity of the images they produce, and what impact these images have on the body figured through these procedures. Accompanying the screen are two free standing steel frames. Within the frames three acrylic panels are hung, etched with patterns which suggest anatomical illustration - one panel looks like a rib cage, another could be a pelvis or a block of flesh. 

Tindle has used several machine learning algorithms to create the imagery featured in this work, including StyleGan2 trained on real X-rays, a pix2pix model for which she created a virtual dataset using blender and a Style Transfer model based on real X-rays scraped from google images.

jmyun001@gold.ac.uk,JAI KWON MYUNG,JAI,"Hi, I'm Jai Myung, digital artist and cyber sculptor. I am currently in Computational Arts MA at Goldsmiths University in London.
I have been doing visual art mainly on sculptures that combine subculture and digital. Please approach here for information and documentation about me (https://jaikwonmyung.com/work)
I'm interested in minor story and under-culture elements. My artworks are inspired by curiosity and imagination for something which does not exist in reality, especially from science fiction. Through my artworks, imaginary things can be embodied as the arts. For
instance, in one of my projects, ‘Bean Sprouts Biopod,’ I created a wearable gear. This project began with my fantasies for a future city where gets renewable energy from an organism such as a plant. In the creative arts, I can express whatever I want to. That is why I love the arts. Thanksalot Always. JAI","'Mama JAI's Farm'","Wiggling changes our lives. Mama Jai's farm system begins with the idea of future food. The BBC reported that Dr.Costas Bellis of Leeds University published paper in 'SCIENCE' that humans would produce 1.3 billion tons of plastic by 2040 (July.2020). Environmental problems can cause human to suffer from food shortages, so we have to prepare for them. Jai's invention, 'The Tower' is a lift-type breeding system developed to raise a plastic-eating insect 'Super Mealworm'. Several types of sensors identify the types of insect evolution and move the floor according to changes to create individual breeding environments. They eat micro-plastics or styrofoams, which will greatly help improve the global environment problem. Awareness can sometimes make humans uncomfortable but also enrich them. Mama Jai makes great food and saves the Earth. I swear, small wiggles and shivers will make a big impact. Please eat bugs and stay healthy.

The piece assumes a transitory status: Connect the people, events and movements in the space, deconstructing, reconstructing and overlapping these elements. Observe transitory variations(repetitive, disjunctive and distorted) of the contents of the continuous sequences and frames, marking and recording as a sketch of the space. 

The piece involves screens, cameras, stepper motors, micro-controllers, ras-pis and stretchy form. Through people detection, cameras will recognize and reprocess the captured images and display them whenever somebody approaches and leaves.

The inspiration of this work is from the concern of transitory status from Liu Cixin's Ball Lightning and The Manhattan Transcripts by Bernard Tschumi. The piece tries to simulate a spatial-transitory sketch to reflect these invisible statuses.","https://drive.google.com/open?id=1H8SH3rMdcVGfNBEQA3vdr8Tam2-0UOxa, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GDRUJw4XOLiwVnyd2Rrr3VVvLbGcA4bf, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kXOIqZwwJHxBdu0GC66IJZH8Eb82KpGt",,https://vimeo.com/user91768126,"This piece uses computer vision, surveilling the people walk around to activate it."

In this, Felix works with the process of restor(y)ation, the idea that the processes of ecological restoration and healing of environment require new stories of our relationships to the places we inhabit*. In his work, Felix creates a visual story about sites in London that are moving through a phase of ecological restoration after being landfill sites. A focus is put on Stave Hill Ecological Park in Rotherhithe, a community led park on the remnants of the London timber docks, and a domestic waste landfill site. The park’s hill was landscaped from rubble and domestic waste excavated from the site. The story is comprised of computational photography of the sites alongside a hypertext animated story on an e-paper screen, live photography of the spirits of the greenhouse, and a modified Kindle containing data about the sites. The story tells of the creation and existence of new spirits of the land through the ritual act of preparing landfill site, referencing the Irish mythological immortal spirits, the Aos Sí, who dwell inside hills, and the formation of earthen long barrows in Neolithic Britain which were ceremonious burial sites.

The room installation explores an alternative, more intimate way of interacting with a commonplace consumer electronics device.

An individual feeds a message on a piece of paper into the printer to be scanned, and then allows the printer to respond by placing the paper back into the paper feeder.
The printer then prints a response on the same paper and passes it back to the individual, who may then respond once again and repeat the cycle, creating a dialogue.
The printer is a connected device, basing its responses on content created by other individuals, published and distributed on the internet, a process of copying and reproducing media, representative of the original role of the telecopying machine before widespread adoption of the internet. Building on the ideas of systems theory and cybernetics, the work attempts to create a network in which the device and the human interacting with it are equal participants.

","A child falling asleep to buildings flying by the window, in the backseat of a car; a melody that relentlessly brings us back to a night walk along the river; the melancholic eyes of passersby; that lady in pink having breakfast on her balcony; the Weeping Willow tree at the corner of your grandmother's house… 
This piece is not about construction, it is not about a city. It is about our perception of spaces, the way we inhabit them physically and build them mentally. 

By establishing a dialogue with technology, it explores ways of building texts and images, and absorbing it, outside of its traditional formats, where tools are not only means to convey a message, but central actors of the project. 

Memories of Cities that Don’t Exist is about the places we have lived, the ones we lost, and those we learnt to love through the imaginaries of others.","https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TMo8rAcC_dvT10PJ1niSpWjPnTJaBLCs",,,""

This project is an indoor interactive installation, which mainly involves interaction, vision and sculpture. The data from headset controls other parts of the device to interact by collecting users' mind wave signals.

This work uses the mind wave Bluetooth transmission technology to collect mind wave data, then through Arduino and the processing to control the vibration motor and visual effect under the influence of brain wave data. The technical function of the installation are data collection and explicit display of mind wave changes. 

When the audience wears the headset, the audience can carefully feel their concentration and relaxation. Different EEG data will produce different interactive effects. The light of the device uses coated convex lens and LED lamp to create a gradual effect, and the water wave under the light mapping will give audience a relaxed and quiet atmosphere.

The author's research interest is art installation and the visualization of personal feelings. The author hopes that the audience will focus on feeling their own feelings and help the audience more clearly feel the brain activities that are difficult to visualize at daily time.","https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tZPs91VH_KwSlXk8OPYuO6kD9wUpItpe",,,"This work uses mind wave sensors.

How does one respond when they cannot know reality?

The VR game follows Ezzi, a young girl with Alzheimer's who's fighting to get her memory back. We experience her mind's unraveling from her point of view making her the ultimate unreliable narrator. You will feel trapped in the room and this is brought to life through game visual tricks.

When we become Ezzi, confusions and duplications make us feel excluded and lonely. Looking for broken memories is just Failed relationships, past traumas, and stolen youth.
One night rendered scenes and textures through Unreal Engine 4, combined with Oculus Quest2 to experience an immersive experience, and created multiple game interactions. The memory display part is through Touchdesigner compute particles, in a fantastic way how life erodes, piece by piece, when Alzheimer takes over Ezzi’s life.

The rain stopped, the sun rises. Anyway, tomorrow is another day. Ezzi still living in a repeated and recycled environment.

Alzheimer's is a cruel and heartless disease that robs any affected patient of their memories, logic, and - ultimately - their dignity.","https://drive.google.com/open?id=15kpFMcdYstceVvpF1V9rI54e0N0MlGz0, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yN8JgCvEJJ_j7LbpIb1FFOGXF1GErTA3",,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDYsuqQCX5M&t=16s,""
