Time Is Inherently Cruel is a video art piece comprised of five ambient GAN paintings. The end result of a six months long performance in which a dataset of sky images was built through a durational process: 1 photo every hour (daylight), every day. A handcrafted machine learning artwork that attempts to contain time by registering a stream of data from the organic world and giving it a life of its own in the digital one. Reflections of moments that are no longer there. A machine’s unique vision of the natural world: canvases in constant flux. The resulting artificial spaces serve as conduits for an inner dialogue –a meditation– about migration and the emotions and feelings that haunt the displaced.
