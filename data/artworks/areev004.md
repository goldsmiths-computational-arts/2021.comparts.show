Xenogenesis acts as a construction and occupation of virtual space by a fluid, transformative entity, Xeno, that looks to queer the purpose of language for new configurations of world building. Comprising of three stages, the initial video becomes an initiation and transportation into this virtual realm. The second stage gives access to the liminal space that Xeno occupies, to promote a delineation from ‘straight time’ in order to indulge in the virtual presence. Finally, the third stage acts as a further introspection into the into Xeno’s environment by transferring the viewers space into a new lexicon of symbols that the virtual entity uses to understand the performative gestures of the human.
