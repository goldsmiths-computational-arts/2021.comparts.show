This piece gives information about different materials like their formation, uses, biodegradability and impact on the environment. The visuals and orientation of the 3D models will give a more concise image of how different and simplistic the base of all materials is, it will also show how integral it is to dispose of and separate wastes to reduce contamination and pollution of the environment. The audience will interact with the models by moving the mouse around and seeing visuals that will put forward the message I am trying to convey via my piece.
