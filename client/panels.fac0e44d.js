How have they been captured and imagined in our technological present and future? Working with ideas such as ‘simulation’, ‘storytelling’ and ‘interactivity’, artists Pietro Bardini, George Micah Kuhn and Katie Tindle explore and challenge views of nature as well as technology through their computational artistic practices. They will be in dialogue with guest speaker Hendrik-Jan Grievink, Designer and Project Lead at the Next Nature Network.
