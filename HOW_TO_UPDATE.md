# How to update your page

There are two forms you need to complete:

- [Part I form - artist biography](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmHKFauB7llCnYPn-QrxvljPoriIc6hLSJ8gXDKqFV-1J9ow/viewform)
- [Part II form - artwork](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-GsbPCEukeBz0XVYLJrxBMT8Djjyh835389A9gLt8XR9maw/viewform)

The pages are automatically generated when I run a script from whatever you submit in the forms! If you need to change something then you need to submit the entire form again including images! You can copy and paste text from what is currently on the page to make it easier. If you type things like "N/A" then that is what will appear on your page. 
**The last thing you have submitted is what gets published, if you make a mistake, submit the whole thing again!** I know it's a pain, I'm sorry but it's the best we have.

You also need to submit all your images each time! Get the sizes correct or they will look stretched

- Bio image **600x600px**
- Artwork images **1920x1080px**

I run the script to update the website a few times a day, so changes probably won't appear until several hours later

Thank you! I hope it goes well!

## Basic markdown guide

The bio, artwork description, web instructions, wall text instructions can all be formatted using Markdown. A basic guide follows.


### Line breaks
